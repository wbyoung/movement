  When driving and entering a zone where the mobile app may end up in a race
  condition state, sending multiple updates simultaneously (see
  home-assistant/core#126972), and the first of such updates arrives, it ignores
  the update by maintaining all state & attributes besides `ignore_count` which
  gets incremented and `history` which includes the new item.
