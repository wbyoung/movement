  When walking from home to a neighbors house, and updates that are
  theoretically from the start of the trip are received within a few seconds of
  each other near the end of the trip (i.e. traveling through a cell dead zone),
  it uses the history to determine a usable entry to calculate the `speed` &
  `mode_of_transit`, skipping the history entries that are recently clustered.
