  When moving at biking speed, and the current mode is still set to driving,
  and the distance covered (including that in transition) is less than 1km, it
  maintains the `mode_of_transit` because the distance threshold was not reached
  and puts the distance change in `transition` (see
  `DISTANCE_THRESHOLDS_BEFORE_MODE_CHANGE` in `coordinator.py`).
