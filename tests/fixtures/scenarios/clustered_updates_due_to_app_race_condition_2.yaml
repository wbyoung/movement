  When driving and entering a zone where the mobile app may end up in a race
  condition state, sending multiple updates simultaneously (see
  home-assistant/core#126972), and the second of such updates arrives, it
  ignores the update by maintaining all state & attributes besides
  `ignore_count` which gets incremented and `history` which includes the new
  item.
