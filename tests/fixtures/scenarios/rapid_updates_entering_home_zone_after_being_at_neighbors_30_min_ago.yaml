  When an several updates are received within a few seconds around home (for
  entering the home zone) after being at the neighbors 30min ago, it uses the
  history to determine a usable entry, ignoring the update that is within a few
  seconds (which would be valid in terms of distance moved overcoming GPS
  accuracy), and using the value older location from the neighbor's house to
  calculate the `speed` & `mode_of_transit`.
