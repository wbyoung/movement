description: >
  When walking after driving home a while ago, and with several small movements
  registering without GPS accuracy high enough to determine speed, it should
  search the accuracy history for a usable item, but should not consider the
  history value that is beyond the stalling timeframe (20 min), so it must put
  the distance into `transition`.
