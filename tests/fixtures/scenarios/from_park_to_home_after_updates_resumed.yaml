  When moving from the nearby park to home with an incomplete item in
  `transition` from 2min ago, it calculates a driving speed, calculates the
  adjustments on the distances in `transition`, increments the state by the
  distance traveled since the last update plus the adjustments for that distance
  and the adjustments from the `transition` object, and updates the
  `adjustments` attribute to include those same adjustments.
