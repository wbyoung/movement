  When moving at biking speed, and the current mode is still set to driving, and
  the distance covered (including that in transition) is greater than 1km, it
  changes the `mode_of_transit` & completes the in progress transition because
  the distance threshold was reached (see
  `DISTANCE_THRESHOLDS_BEFORE_MODE_CHANGE` in `coordinator.py`).
