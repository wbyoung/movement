  When a change occurs, and there are more items in transition than before, but
  there is currently no listener/timer/timeout configured (i.e. no
  `_updates_stalled_listener` instance var due to no `mock_cancel_callback` in
  the `additional_setup` section below), it updates the state to 20 min from
  now.
